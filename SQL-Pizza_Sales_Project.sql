-- Question & Answer

-- 1) Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
select count(order_id) as total_orders from orders;

-- 2) Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
select round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price),2) as total_revenue from order_details join pizzas
on order_details.pizza_id =pizzas.pizza_id;

-- 3) Identify the highest-priced pizza.
select pizza_types.name, pizzas.price from pizza_types join pizzas on 
pizza_types.pizza_type_id=pizzas.pizza_type_id order by price desc limit 1 ;

-- 4) Identify the most ordered order id with quantity.
select quantity , count(order_details_id) from order_details group by quantity;

-- 4) Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
select pizzas.size, count(order_details.order_details_id) as order_count from pizzas join order_details on
pizzas.pizza_id=order_details.pizza_id group by pizzas.size order by order_count desc ;

-- 5) List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
select pizza_types.name,sum(order_details.quantity) as total_quantity from pizza_types join pizzas on
pizza_types.pizza_type_id=pizzas.pizza_type_id join order_details on
order_details.pizza_id=pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.name order by total_quantity desc limit 5 ;

-- 6) Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
select pizza_types.category,sum(order_details.quantity) as total_quatity from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id=pizzas.pizza_type_id join order_details on order_details.pizza_id=pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category order by total_quatity desc;

-- 7) Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
select hour(order_time) as hour ,count(order_id) from orders group by hour order by count(order_id) desc;

-- 8) join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
select category ,count(name) from pizza_types group by category order by count(name) desc;

-- 9) Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
select round(avg(total_quantity),2) as avg_ordered_pizza_per_day from (select orders.date,sum(order_details.quantity) as total_quantity
from orders join order_details on orders.order_id=order_details.order_id
group by orders.date) as order_quantity;

-- 10) Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

(select round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price),2) as total_sales from order_details join pizzas on
pizzas.pizza_id=order_details.pizza_id)*100,2)as revenue
from pizza_types join pizzas on
